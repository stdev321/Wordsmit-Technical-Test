# Wordsmith Technical Test

This repository contains the code for the Wordsmith Technical Test. It includes an account management API and a memoization function for number conversion. Below are instructions on how to run the code and use the provided features.

## Account Management API

To set up and run the account management API, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running the command: `npm install`

2. Start the express server in development mode using the command: `npm run serve`

3. To run the express server in production mode, build the project using: `npm run build` and then start the server using: `npm start`

4. To test the API, you can import the attached Postman collection named `account-management-api.postman_collection.json`

## Memorizer Function

To use the memorizer function for caching return values, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages globally by running the command: `npm install -g ts-node typescript '@types/node'`

2. Execute the TypeScript file using the command: `ts-node index.ts`

3. Check the terminal to view the results of the function execution with caching.

## Number Conversion

To convert Arabic numbers to Roman numerals, follow these steps:
